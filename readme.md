# Bash Profile

This is a running list of my current bash environment functions and aliases.

I put it on GitHub to share in case anyone else is interested.

## Setup

To set up the bash environment, simply download the setprofile.sh script and run it in your bash terminal. The basic steps are:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deanhouseholder/bash-profile/master/setprofile.sh -o setprofile.sh
source setprofile.sh
```

## Removal

To remove the pieces installed by `setprofile.sh` you can run `remove_profile.sh`.
